TEST 0: Remove Small Objects
January 29, 2021:
remove_small_objects took 0.149 ms with findContours.
remove_small_objects took 4.550 ms with connectedComponentsWithStats.

TEST 1: Compute Region Props
January 29, 2021
Computing region props took 15.463 ms with findContours.
Computing region props took 13.233 ms with connectedComponentsWithStats.

***But, I can't easily compute ellipse properties (orientation, major/minor
axes) using connectedComponentsWithStats, so there's a tradeoff between time and
functionality. Because the difference in execution time is small (~15%), I will
go with the improved functionality of findContours for now.

TEST 0: Remove Small Objects
remove_small_objects took 0.026 ms with findContours on average over 11089 iterations.
remove_small_objects took 0.207 ms with connectedComponentsWithStats over 11089 iterations.

TEST 1: Compute Region Props
Computing region props took 0.019 ms with findContours over 11089 iterations.
Computing region props took 0.101 ms with connectedComponentsWithStats over 11089 iterations.

CONCLUSION: `findContours` is much faster. Combined with improved functionality (can fit ellipse 
and use it to compute major axis, minor axis, and orientation), it is the superior.
